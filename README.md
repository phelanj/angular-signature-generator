# SignatureGenerator

The goal of this project is to expedite the process of setting up email signatures for Moda employees.

The signature is stored as a concatenated string in typescript with dynamic variables set by the user to determine name, job title, and address. The signature is displayed on the screen using angular innerHTML binding. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.
